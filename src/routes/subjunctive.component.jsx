      <h4>Subjunctive</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>To say "I want to be rich" is literally "I want that I am rich": θέλω να είμαι πλούσιος. "I want to always speak Greek" is literally "I want that I speak always Greek.", so this phrase would be θέλω να μιλάω πάντα ελληνικά.</li>
          <li>You cannot avoid this "I want that I speak" structure. And when it's someone else who is wishing for something, you have to adjust accordingly. "He wants to be rich" translates to "He wants that he is rich," which is θέλει να είναι πλούσιος. Both verbs adjust: θέλω becomes θέλει, and είμαι becomes είναι. "You want to always speak Greek" is "you want that you speak always Greek," or θέλεις να μιλάς πάντα ελληνικά.</li>
          <li>On the bright side, this makes more complex wishes easier. For example, "I want you to always speak Greek" is "I want that you speak always Greek": θέλω να μιλάς πάντα ελληνικά. Θέλω is "I want," and μιλάς is "you speak." In Greek sentences, it is always clear who is to do what.  </li>
          <li>We express a negative wish with μη (or μην, if the next word begins with a vowel or the letters κ, π, τ, ξ, ψ, μπ, ντ, γκ, τσ, and τζ). As said, θέλω να μη δουλεύω, which means "I want that not I work" or "I want not to work." Do not confuse this with δεν θέλω να δουλεύω, meaning "I don't want to work," which has a similar but not identical meaning.</li>
          <li>Either way, the να always introduces the wish. So when you have a freestanding να without any θέλω, we still interpret it as a wish or suggestion. For example, asked Μήπως να πάμε για πρωινό τώρα; meaning "Maybe we should go have breakfast now?"</li>
